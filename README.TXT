This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ

It is discussed in chapter 1.

This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

You can create various shapes, and you will see, if you do, that those
shapes are drawn on screen (in a window that we call the "canvas").

You can then manipulate these objects: change their position, size and 
colour. Try it out: create a few different squares, triangles and circles.

This project is designed as a first example of object-oriented programming.
It illustrates a number of concepts:

 - a Java project (application) is a collection of classes
 - objects can be created from classes
 - from any one class, many objects may be created
 - objects have operations (methods)
 - operations can have parameters
 - parameters have types (at least String and int)
 - objects hold data (fields)
 - the operations and fields are common to all objects
 - the values stored in the fields can be different for each object

The project also demonstrates

 - BlueJ object creation
 - interactive method invocation
 - parameter passing

A good second project to look at after this is "picture", which adds a class
to those ones in this project. That class (named "Picture") uses the shapes
to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with coding.
Classes Included
- Canvas.java
- Circle.java
- Person.java
- Square.java
- Triangle.java

Questions:
2. When I call moveDown twice, the circle moved down 2 pixels and when it was three times, it went down 3 pixels. When I called makeInvisible once, the circle disappeared and when I did it again it didn't change it was still invisble.
3. To moveHorizontal the circle 70 pixels to the left, I had to write -70. 
4. When I Invoked the changeColor method without quotes it said Error: cannot find symbol.
9. To create the imagine, I created 4 objects in total: 1 green big circle for the mountain/grass, 1 small yellow circle for the sun, 1 person that was tall and 1 peerson that was shorter. I used the methods (moveVertical, moveHorizontal, changeSize and changeColor) to achieve this. I don't have the numbers I used but it was trial and error until I was satisfied with the placements. I am pretty sure you can do it in other ways. I think you can write it in the code exactly how you want it and it will pop up if u click on a method.
